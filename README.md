# Name
Pronounced: Âvâ sarâ (normal a = the a in cat, â as in the a in car)
From persian origin and means "Composer of hymns" but more poetic

# Why?
I needed to convert every audio file/data/thing into a small, compressed, and
audibly lossy format for mass storage of many of em, so I made Ava sara, it
does quite a lot of useful stuff, so feel free to check out the `examples`
folder and have fun!

# Features
- Decoding many formats with automatic detection (check the docs)
- Pitch analysis using the YIN algorithm (check docs please)
- Interleaver function included for automatic conversion of stereo to mono
  (check docs, again)
- Re-exported `vorbis_rs` for convenience (the best vorbis {de/en}coding
  library available)
- Re-exported `optivorbis` for convenience as well (the best vorbis
  optimization lib available)
- Compose function that chains every step from decoding to encoding and
  optimizing included (check docs!!!!)

# License
Better call sâlâr (all the code here is subject to MPL2.0 license, have fun
with it)
